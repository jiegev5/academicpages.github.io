My supervisor is Asst Prof [Tan Rui](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/tanrui/). My research interest is exploiting phsical knowledge into AIoT. You can find more about our research at [NTU IoT Sensing Group website](https://ntuiot.xyz/).

I obtained bachelor's degree from School of Electrical and Electronic of Engineering with 2nd upper degree in 2015. I worked at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com/) for 4 years after graduation. From 2015 to 2018, I worked as a product engineer at MSB, where my job scope is developing Functional Development Verification (FDV) test for [Micron 3D NAND products](https://www.micron.com/products/nand-flash). I joined Yield Enhancement team at Fab10N in August of 2018, where I worked as a Electrical Failure Analysis (EFA). The new job scope is to perform wafer-level electrical failure analysis for NAND products.

Interests
------
I watch NBA games, I am a fan of [Lebron James](https://twitter.com/KingJames) and [Lakers](https://twitter.com/Lakers). I like playing basketball, with friends. I exercise daily, either go to gym (I don't do heavy weight, neither drink protein) or exercise at home (push-ups, sit-ups, hand stand and burpees). I don't like running, but I run regularly. I like swimming, while I prefer to go with friends.
