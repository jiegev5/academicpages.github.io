In computer vision (CV) domain, object recognition is a general term, it is refering to a collection of challenging CV tasks that aim to identify objects in a digital image:
- Image classification: assign a class label to a given image
- Object localization: identify the location of the objects, drawing a bounding box around the objects
- Objection detection: a combination of previous tasks. It requires first identify the location of the objects in the image, then assign the corresponding labels
- Object segmentation: Similar to object detection, instead of applying bounding boxes on the objects, object segmentation highlight the objects in pixel level.

Object detection is becoming pervasive nowadays, thanks to the advancement in CV domain. It is used in optical character recognition (OCR) system to exract digital texts from scanned documents. It widely deployed in autonomous driving system for traffic sign detection/recognition, as well as vehicle detection. Most commonly, it is used in crowd control for face detection and recognition, etc. More application of object detection can be found in this [paper](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I4920.pdf).
Right now, state-of-art object detection models are DNN-based. Among different architectures, the most famous are R-CNN and YOLO family.

R-CNN family
======
R-CNN stands for "Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network", it was developed by Ross Girshick, et al. in 2014. R-CNN is first model that combines the region proposal with convolutional neural network, it achived state-of-art object detection on benchmark datasets by then. However, R-CNN takes ~47s to process a single image on CPU. This is because R-CNN comprises multiple pipelines: CNN, SVM classfier and bounding-box regressor. Long processing time stems R-CNN in application of real-time object detection. Ross proposed fast R-CNN to improve the detection speed. Fast R-CNN uses a single model to predict class labels and refiniing bounding boxes. This model is significantly faster, yet it still need to process >2k region proposals for each image. Faster R-CNN is therefore developed to refine region proposals by using a Region Proposal Network (RPN). It decreases the region proposals from >2k to ~400. Faster R-CNN can achieve real-time object detection, with ~5 frames per seconds on CPU.
